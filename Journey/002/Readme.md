# Day 2 of Journey

## AWS Website

I completed this project to showcase my ability to create static websites using AWS. 

## Prerequisite

If you are new to AWS, you will need to understand how S3 works and all of its abilities when it comes to storage and static websites.

## Use Case

- http://smith.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
- This code was used to create a gaming website. The code used was free and found online. 

## Cloud Research

- One important thing to remember is that when using S3 as a website, you must turn off the block it creates for public access or no one will be able to view your website.


## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

I was unable to figure out how to add my saved image on my desktop to my visual code. I reviewing how to complete the task and will make the proper edits once I learn.


## Next Steps

With my next project I wil launch a Windows Virtual Machine.

## Social Proof
